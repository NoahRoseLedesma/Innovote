    <br>The new age of bike share in Seattle has lead to marketing battle between three companies all looking to fill the space <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/seattle-pronto-bike-share-shutting-down-friday/">vacated by Pronto</a>. It has also lead to an increase in undocked bikes <a href="https://twitter.com/docklessbike">littering the streets</a>&nbsp;and to a renewed conversation about helmet laws in our city.
    <br>
    <br><strong>Prompt</strong>

Provide a solution, whether it be a new helmet, system, or policy that will lead to fewer cyclist breaking the law while preserving the safety of our velo favoring friends. Be original and creative but also look at what works in other places around the world while considering the needs and conditions of Seattle cyclists.&nbsp;
